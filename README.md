# roverMoving
Control an arduino "rover" kit with a wireless PS2 controller using tank control.
- Wiring for the PS2 Receiver: Clock = 13, Data = 12, Command = 11, Attention = 10.
- Wiring for the H-bridge: ENA = 5, IN1 = 3, IN2 = 4, IN3 = 2, IN4 = 2, ENB = 6
- I did not write the PS2X library.
- The "RoverCodeFinal" section was entirely written by msyelf. 
- This code is to function a "rover" using 1 H-bridge and the PS2 wireless controller.
